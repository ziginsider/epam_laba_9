        original span of the saga going from being Anakin Skywalker, the prophesied child who

        to being the pivotal antagonist, and eventual redemption and fulfillment of the prophecy.

    <string name="url_three_decr">Yoda is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise created
        by George Lucas, first appearing in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back. In the original
        films, he trains Luke Skywalker to fight against the Galactic Empire. In the prequel films,
        he serves as the Grand Master of the Jedi Order and as a high-ranking general of Clone
        Troopers in the Clone Wars. Before his death in Return of the Jedi at the age of 900,

        introduction of Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
